## Hi there! 👋

Tech‑curious tinkerer with a sense of humor, always exploring new tools, breaking things on purpose (or by accident), and occasionally getting distracted by the next shiny innovation.

## About Me

Hey, I’m **1IntereJurry**!

I’m a junior developer and tech enthusiast who loves experimenting, exploring new software, and diving into anything that looks like the next big innovation. Whether it’s a fresh framework, a shiny tool, or something like KIO that sparks my curiosity, I’m usually the first one poking around to see what it can do.
My projects range from “surprisingly useful” to “I got distracted halfway through but it still kind of works.” I break things, fix them, break them again, and laugh my way through the debugging chaos.
If my code makes you smile: totally normal.
If you understand all of it: legendary.
Feedback, ideas, and nerdy conversations are always welcome.
